            <h2>SAGE</h2>
            <p>
                The stronghold of China, Sage creates safety for herself and her team wherever she goes. Able to revive fallen friends and stave off aggressive pushes, she provides a calm center to a hellish fight.
                Described as a stronghold, Sage is an agent who always looks out for her teammates and offers help whenever she can. She has fully embraced her powers which give her control of life, and wishes to use them to keep her team alive for as long as possible. 
                Calmer and more collected than some of her more energetic allies, Sage always imparts encouraging words to rally the team up and guide them to victory.

        <div id="content2">
            <h2>OMEN</h2>
            <p>
                A living nightmare, Omen takes full advantage of his shadowed physique and will not hesitate to eliminate his enemies using the forces of paranoia and fear. He is cynical in nature, which stems from him experiencing extreme pain as he was condemned to remain in the state that he is today. If there's one person who wants to know more about his mysterious circumstances, it's Omen himself - and quite desperately so. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="content3">
            <h2>PHEONIX</h2>
            <p>
                Hailing from the U.K., Phoenix's star power shines through in his fighting style, igniting the battlefield with flash and flare. Whether he's got backup or not, he'll rush into a fight on his own terms.
                A duelist by role and nature, Phoenix is brash, impulsive, and has a lot of confidence, never hesitating to charge into a fight head-on despite not getting a full grasp of the situation, much to the chagrin of his more collected teammates.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="content4">
            <h2>CYPHER</h2>
            <p>
                Cypher is constantly gathering secrets, information, and intel, to the point of managing to retrieve the passwords of everyone in the VALORANT Protocol. He keeps most of this information to himself, making sure that no one ever discovers them and only revealing anything he knows for a price. In contrast of how he knows a lot about his allies, they do not know much about him, and he prefers to keep it that way. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div id="content5">
            <h2>JETT</h2>
            <p>
                The wind is commonly known for being cool, but Jett is an aggressive agent who has a distinctive, sarcastic personality. Jett also has a cheeky, childish "in-your-face" attitude, seen commonly giving insults for feats she makes on the team and is always spouting her sheer amount of arrogance. Her self-confidence may feel as if she is disregarding her comrades' safety, but she has recognized that it is best to play with a team, albeit with some reluctance. She does show a much more friendly personality towards teammates.
